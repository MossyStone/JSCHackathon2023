# JSCHackathon2023
The team John Glenn, composed of Tyler Morris, Lauren Roesler, Luis Aguilar, and Madison Reynolds, solution towards JSC Hack 2023. Team John Glenn worked on solving Challenge 1. They took a collobrative effort on disecting the problem and then mangaging task. Each member contritubed by designing, reasearhcing, and emplimenting one of their games with eachother. Their games focus on mental, physical, and social ascpect of isolation thaat astronaughts would face in year(s) long missions. 

## Challenge 1: Crew Entertainment System

Given Prompt: 
Mental health is important, and there is no exception for astronauts on long-duration space missions. Using the provided guidelines, develop a Crew Entertainment System that will aid in maintaining the psychological health of an eight-person crew during 1-5 year missions in the Common Habitat, a conceptual design being explored for possible missions across the inner solar system in the post-Artemis timeframe.

Wardroom Details:
- The wardroom shall use eight Multi-Gravity Crew Seats.  The design of the MCGS is not publicly available yet.  For purposes of this challenge, substitute generic bar stools with arm rests.
- The wardroom shall be reconfigurable to support different crew activities including crew meetings, stationary recreation (e.g., board games), lounging, movie watching, and dynamic recreation (open floor space for games requiring moving within a small area).  
- The wardroom shall include a projector, speakers, microphone, and wide projection screen.
- The wardroom includes a deployable / reconfigurable table system sized for eight crew to dine together.  This table may be a single table surface, or it may subdivide into two table surfaces.
- The wardroom table includes built-in interfaces for computer display and control, video communication, and audio communication.
- The wardroom table is mounted to the tops of two stacks of four mid deck lockers.  If desired, two, three, or four lockers may be substituted for a double, triple, or quad-height locker.

Crew Entertainment System Details:
- All Crew Entertainment System activities must promote social interaction among the crew.
- Games must include (but are not limited to) both physical activity games and table games, subject to the following definitions:
  - Physical activity games are those where the participants are not seated, and some level of physical motion is involved.  All seats and tables are stowed.  (Frisbee, miniature golf, and dodgeball are terrestrial examples.)
  - Table games are those played where the participants are seated, and the table is used as a surface.  (Card games, monopoly, and scrabble are terrestrial examples.)
  - Traditional video games are not included in this activity.  In general, if a crew member could play the game in a single player mode alone in their crew quarters that game falls outside the scope of this exercise.
  - Avoid the use of existing games and attempt to come up with new game ideas.
