# JSCHackathon2023
The team John Glenn, composed of Tyler Morris, Lauren Roesler, Luis Aguilar, and Madison Reynolds, their solution to JSC Hack 2023 challenge. Team John Glenn worked on solving Challenge 1. They took a collaborative effort on dissecting the problem and then manage the task. Each member contributed by designing, researching, and implementing one of their games with each other. Their games focus on the mental, physical, and social aspects of isolation that astronauts would face in the year(s) long missions. 

## Challenge 1: Crew Entertainment System

**Given Prompt:**

Mental health is important, and there is no exception for astronauts on long-duration space missions. Using the provided guidelines, develop a Crew Entertainment System that will aid in maintaining the psychological health of an eight-person crew during 1-5 year missions in the Common Habitat, a conceptual design being explored for possible missions across the inner solar system in the post-Artemis timeframe.

**Wardroom Details:**
- The wardroom shall use eight Multi-Gravity Crew Seats.  The design of the MCGS is not publicly available yet.  For purposes of this challenge, substitute generic bar stools with armrests.
- The wardroom shall be reconfigurable to support different crew activities including crew meetings, stationary recreation (e.g., board games), lounging, movie watching, and dynamic recreation (open floor space for games requiring moving within a small area).  
- The wardroom shall include a projector, speakers, microphone, and wide projection screen.
- The wardroom includes a deployable/reconfigurable table system sized for eight crew to dine together.  This table may be a single table surface, or it may subdivide into two table surfaces.
- The wardroom table includes built-in interfaces for computer display and control, video communication, and audio communication.
- The wardroom table is mounted to the tops of two stacks of four mid-deck lockers.  Two, three, or four lockers may be substituted for a double, triple, or quad-height locker if desired.

**Crew Entertainment System Details:**
- All Crew Entertainment System activities must promote social interaction among the crew.
- Games must include (but are not limited to) both physical activity games and table games, subject to the following definitions:
  - Physical activity games are those where the participants are not seated, and some level of physical movement is involved.  All seats and tables are stowed.  (Frisbee, miniature golf, and dodgeball are terrestrial examples.)
  - Table games are those played where the participants are seated, and the table is used as a surface.  (Card games, monopoly, and Scrabble are terrestrial examples.)
  - Traditional video games are not included in this activity.  In general, if a crew member could play the game in a single-player mode alone in their crew quarters that game falls outside the scope of this exercise.
  - Avoid the use of existing games and attempt to come up with new game ideas.

**Dimension Details:**
- Lockers are 20.32 in x 17.31 in x 9.95 in
   - You get 6 of the 8 lockers to use.
- Each foot locker can hold a maximum of 74 pounds
- The table seats 4 people on each long side
- You get 8 barstool like chairs with arms

**Requirements:**
- 36 games minimum with a breakdown of
  - 24+ Physical Games
  - 8+ Table Games
  - 4+ Other Category games
- Each gravity environment (ie microgravity – 0g, lunar gravity – 1/6g, and Mars gravity – 3/8g) must include these games
  - At least two physical activity games played by two persons.
  - At least two physical activity games that are played by four persons.
  - At least two physical activity games that are played by eight persons.
  - No less than two physical activity games that can be played by a variable number of crew, no less than two, and no more than eight persons.
  - No less than four entertainment activities that are not games and involve more than one crew member.
- Each table game must be playable in 0g, 1/6g, and 3/8g
- Games must be viable regardless of crew gender, age, body size, and nationality – all of which will vary across the different crews assigned to Common Habitat missions (within astronaut selection criteria).
- All Crew Entertainment System items (excluding permanently mounted items such as the video projector) must stow within six of the eight mid-deck lockers beneath the wardroom table when not in use.
- The Crew Entertainment System shall include both fixed audio speakers and wireless headphones.  Headphones are stored with individual crew members personal items in their crew quarters and do not need to be accounted for in this design challenge.
